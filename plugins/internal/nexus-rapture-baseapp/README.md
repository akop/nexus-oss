= Nexus Rapture Baseapp

This module provides the baseapp muck for ExtJS 4+ pre-compiled with Sencha CMD.

Requires Sencha CMD 4+

Recompile is manual via build.sh script ATM, afterwards the changes should be committed.

When updating baseapp/ext need to be aware there are directories named 'target':
* ext/src/fx/target

May completely revisit this solution later.
